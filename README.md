# Genshin Impact Team Tracker

## What is Genshin Impact Team Tracker?

<p>The Genshin Impact Team Tracker will allow the user to save teams of four characters for the
Spiral Abyss game mode. Users will be shown the possible elemental reactions and elemental resonance present within the 
teams. 

**Inspiration**: a desire to save my own teams for future reference.</p> 

## Who will use this?

<p>Genshin Impact players who challenge the Spiral Abyss will use this application to save their previous team 
compositions for future reference (since the Spiral Abyss is constantly changing).</p>
